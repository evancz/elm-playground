-- PICTURE


{-| Make a picture! Here is a picture of a triangle with an eyeball:

    import Playground exposing (..)

    main =
      picture
        [ triangle green 150
        , circle white 40
        , circle black 10
        ]

-}

    view screen =
      { title = "Playground"
      , body = [ render screen shapes ]
      }

    update (width,height) _ =
      ( toScreen (toFloat width) (toFloat height)
      , Cmd.none
      )

    subscriptions _ =
      E.onResize Tuple.pair

    { init = init
    , view = view
    , update = update
    , subscriptions = subscriptions
    }



-- COMPUTER


{-| When writing a [`game`](#game), you can look up all sorts of information
about your computer:

  - [`Mouse`](#Mouse) - Where is the mouse right now?
  - [`Keyboard`](#Keyboard) - Are the arrow keys down?
  - [`Screen`](#Screen) - How wide is the screen?
  - [`Time`](#Time) - What time is it right now?

So you can use expressions like `computer.mouse.x` and `computer.keyboard.enter`
in games where you want some mouse or keyboard interaction.
-}
type alias Computer =
  { mouse : Mouse
  , keyboard : Keyboard
  , screen : Screen
  , time : Time
  }



-- MOUSE


{-| Figure out what is going on with the mouse.

You could draw a circle around the mouse with a program like this:

    import Playground exposing (..)

    main =
      game view update 0

    view computer memory =
      [ circle yellow 40
          |> moveX computer.mouse.x
          |> moveY computer.mouse.y
      ]

    update computer memory =
      memory

You could also use `computer.mouse.down` to change the color of the circle
while the mouse button is down.
-}
type alias Mouse =
  { x : Number
  , y : Number
  , down : Bool
  , click : Bool
  }


{-| A number like `1` or `3.14` or `-120`.
-}
type alias Number = Float



-- KEYBOARD


{-| Figure out what is going on with the keyboard.

If someone is pressing the UP and RIGHT arrows, you will see a value like this:

    { up = True, down = False, left = False, right = True
    , space = False, enter = False, shift = False, backspace = False
    , keys = Set.fromList ["ArrowUp","ArrowRight"]
    }

So if you want to move a character based on arrows, you could write an update
like this:

    update computer y =
      if computer.keyboard.up then
        y + 1
      else
        y

Check out [`toX`](#toX) and [`toY`](#toY) which make this even easier!

**Note:** The `keys` set will be filled with the name of all keys which are
down right now. So you will see things like `"a"`, `"b"`, `"c"`, `"1"`, `"2"`,
`"Space"`, and `"Control"` in there. Check out [this list][list] to see the
names used for all the different special keys! From there, you can use
[`Set.member`][member] to check for whichever key you want. E.g.
`Set.member "Control" computer.keyboard.keys`.

[list]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key/Key_Values
[member]: /packages/elm/core/latest/Set#member
-}
type alias Keyboard =
  { up : Bool
  , down : Bool
  , left : Bool
  , right : Bool
  , space : Bool
  , enter : Bool
  , shift : Bool
  , backspace : Bool
  , keys : Set.Set String
  }


{-| Turn the LEFT and RIGHT arrows into a number.

    toX { left = False, right = False, ... } == 0
    toX { left = True , right = False, ... } == -1
    toX { left = False, right = True , ... } == 1
    toX { left = True , right = True , ... } == 0

So to make a square move left and right based on the arrow keys, we could say:

    import Playground exposing (..)

    main =
      game view update 0

    view computer x =
      [ square green 40
          |> moveX x
      ]

    update computer x =
      x + toX computer.keyboard

-}
toX : Keyboard -> Number
toX keyboard =
  (if keyboard.right then 1 else 0) - (if keyboard.left then 1 else 0)


{-| Turn the UP and DOWN arrows into a number.

    toY { up = False, down = False, ... } == 0
    toY { up = True , down = False, ... } == 1
    toY { up = False, down = True , ... } == -1
    toY { up = True , down = True , ... } == 0

This can be used to move characters around in games just like [`toX`](#toX):

    import Playground exposing (..)

    main =
      game view update (0,0)

    view computer (x,y) =
      [ square blue 40
          |> move x y
      ]

    update computer (x,y) =
      ( x + toX computer.keyboard
      , y + toY computer.keyboard
      )

-}
toY : Keyboard -> Number
toY keyboard =
  (if keyboard.up then 1 else 0) - (if keyboard.down then 1 else 0)


{-| If you just use `toX` and `toY`, you will move diagonal too fast. You will go
right at 1 pixel per update, but you will go up/right at 1.41421 pixels per
update.

So `toXY` turns the arrow keys into an `(x,y)` pair such that the distance is
normalized:

    toXY { up = True , down = False, left = False, right = False, ... } == (1, 0)
    toXY { up = True , down = False, left = False, right = True , ... } == (0.707, 0.707)
    toXY { up = False, down = False, left = False, right = True , ... } == (0, 1)

Now when you go up/right, you are still going 1 pixel per update.

    import Playground exposing (..)

    main =
      game view update (0,0)

    view computer (x,y) =
      [ square green 40
          |> move x y
      ]

    update computer (x,y) =
      let
        (dx,dy) = toXY computer.keyboard
      in
      (x + dx, y + dy)

-}
toXY : Keyboard -> (Number, Number)
toXY keyboard =
  let
    x = toX keyboard
    y = toY keyboard
  in
  if x /= 0 && y /= 0 then
    (x / squareRootOfTwo, y / squareRootOfTwo)
  else
    (x,y)


squareRootOfTwo : Number
squareRootOfTwo =
  sqrt 2



-- SCREEN


{-| Get the dimensions of the screen. If the screen is 800 by 600, you will see
a value like this:

    { width = 800
    , height = 600
    , top = 300
    , left = -400
    , right = 400
    , bottom = -300
    }

This can be nice when used with [`moveY`](#moveY) if you want to put something
on the bottom of the screen, no matter the dimensions.
-}
type alias Screen =
  { width : Number
  , height : Number
  , top : Number
  , left : Number
  , right : Number
  , bottom : Number
  }



-- TIME


{-| The current time.

Helpful when making an [`animation`](#animation) with functions like
[`spin`](#spin), [`wave`](#wave), and [`zigzag`](#zigzag).
-}
type Time = Time Time.Posix


{-| Create an angle that cycles from 0 to 360 degrees over time.

Here is an [`animation`](#animation) with a spinning triangle:

    import Playground exposing (..)

    main =
      animation view

    view time =
      [ triangle orange 50
          |> rotate (spin 8 time)
      ]

It will do a full rotation once every eight seconds. Try changing the `8` to
a `2` to make it do a full rotation every two seconds. It moves a lot faster!
-}
spin : Number -> Time -> Number
spin period time =
  360 * toFrac period time


{-| Smoothly wave between two numbers.

Here is an [`animation`](#animation) with a circle that resizes:

    import Playground exposing (..)

    main =
      animation view

    view time =
      [ circle lightBlue (wave 50 90 7 time)
      ]

The radius of the circle will cycles between 50 and 90 every seven seconds.
It kind of looks like it is breathing.
-}
wave : Number -> Number -> Number -> Time -> Number
wave lo hi period time =
  lo + (hi - lo) * (1 + cos (turns (toFrac period time))) / 2


{-| Zig zag between two numbers.

Here is an [`animation`](#animation) with a rectangle that tips back and forth:

    import Playground exposing (..)

    main =
      animation view

    view time =
      [ rectangle lightGreen 20 100
          |> rotate (zigzag -20 20 4 time)
      ]

It gets rotated by an angle. The angle cycles from -20 degrees to 20 degrees
every four seconds.
-}
zigzag : Number -> Number -> Number -> Time -> Number
zigzag lo hi period time =
  lo + (hi - lo) * abs (2 * toFrac period time - 1)


toFrac : Float -> Time -> Float
toFrac period (Time posix) =
  let
    ms = Time.posixToMillis posix
    p = period * 1000
  in
  toFloat (modBy (round p) ms) / p



-- ANIMATION


{-| Create an animation!

Once you get comfortable using [`picture`](#picture) to layout shapes, you can
try out an `animation`. Here is square that zigzags back and forth:

    import Playground exposing (..)

    main =
      animation view

    view time =
      [ square blue 40
          |> moveX (zigzag -100 100 2 time)
      ]

We need to define a `view` to make our animation work.

Within `view` we can use functions like [`spin`](#spin), [`wave`](#wave),
and [`zigzag`](#zigzag) to move and rotate our shapes.
-}

    init () =
      ( Animation E.Visible (toScreen 600 600) (Time (Time.millisToPosix 0))

      )

    view (Animation _ screen time) =
      { title = "Playground"
      , body = [ render screen (viewFrame time) ]
      }

    update msg model =
      ( animationUpdate msg model
      , Cmd.none
      )

    subscriptions (Animation visibility _ _) =
      case visibility of

    MouseButton _          -> state



-- GAME


{-| Create a game!

Once you get comfortable with [`animation`](#animation), you can try making a
game with the keyboard and mouse. Here is an example of a green square that
just moves to the right:

    import Playground exposing (..)

    main =
      game view update 0

    view computer offset =
      [ square green 40
          |> moveRight offset
      ]

    update computer offset =
      offset + 0.03

This shows the three important parts of a game:

1. `memory` - makes it possible to store information. So with our green square,
we save the `offset` in memory. It starts out at `0`.
2. `view` - lets us say which shapes to put on screen. So here we move our
square right by the `offset` saved in memory.
3. `update` - lets us update the memory. We are incrementing the `offset` by
a tiny amount on each frame.

The `update` function is called about 60 times per second, so our little
changes to `offset` start to add up pretty quickly!

This game is not very fun though! Making a `game` also gives you access to the
[`Computer`](#Computer), so you can use information about the [`Mouse`](#Mouse)
and [`Keyboard`](#Keyboard) to make it interactive! So here is a red square that
moves based on the arrow keys:

    import Playground exposing (..)

    main =
      game view update (0,0)

    view computer (x,y) =
      [ square red 40
          |> move x y
      ]

    update computer (x,y) =
      ( x + toX computer.keyboard
      , y + toY computer.keyboard
      )

Notice that in the `update` we use information from the keyboard to update the
`x` and `y` values. These building blocks let you make pretty fancy games!
-}

      , body = [ render computer.screen (viewMemory computer memory) ]

  | Words Color String
  | Group (List Shape)


{-| Make circles:

    dot = circle red 10
    sun = circle yellow 300

You give a color and then the radius. So the higher the number, the larger
the circle.
-}
circle : Color -> Number -> Shape
circle color radius =
  Shape 0 0 0 1 1 (Circle color radius)


{-| Make ovals:

    football = oval brown 200 100

You give the color, and then the width and height. So our `football` example
is 200 pixels wide and 100 pixels tall.
-}
oval : Color -> Number -> Number -> Shape
oval color width height =

    import Playground exposing (..)

    main =
      picture
        [ square purple 80
        , square white 60
        ]

be 80 pixels by 80 pixels.
-}
square : Color -> Number -> Shape
square color n =
  Shape 0 0 0 1 1 (Rectangle color n n)


{-| Make rectangles. This example makes a red cross:

    main =
      picture
        [ rectangle red 20 60
        , rectangle red 60 20
        ]

You give the color, width, and then height. So the first shape is vertical
part of the cross, the thinner and taller part.
-}

do a simple version like this:

    import Playground exposing (..)

    main =
      picture
        [ triangle darkYellow 200
        ]

The number is the "radius", so the distance from the center to each point of
the pyramid is `200`. Pretty big!
-}
triangle : Color -> Number -> Shape
triangle color radius =
  Shape 0 0 0 1 1 (Ngon color 3 radius)


{-| Make pentagons:

    import Playground exposing (..)

    main =
      picture
        [ pentagon darkGrey 100
        ]

You give the color and then the radius. So the distance from the center to each
of the five points is 100 pixels.
-}
pentagon : Color -> Number -> Shape
pentagon color radius =
  Shape 0 0 0 1 1 (Ngon color 5 radius)


{-| Make hexagons:

    import Playground exposing (..)

    main =
      picture
        [ hexagon lightYellow 50
        ]

The number is the radius, the distance from the center to each point.

If you made more hexagons, you could [`move`](#move) them around to make a
honeycomb pattern!
-}
hexagon : Color -> Number -> Shape
hexagon color radius =
  Shape 0 0 0 1 1 (Ngon color 6 radius)


{-| Make octogons:

  import Playground exposing (..)

  main =
    picture
      [ octagon red 100
      ]

You give the color and radius, so each point of this stop sign is 100 pixels
from the center.

    main =

        [ polygon [ (-10,-20), (0,100), (10,-20) ]
        ]

**Note:** If you [`rotate`](#rotate) a polygon, it will always rotate around
`(0,0)`. So it is best to build your shapes around that point, and then use
[`move`](#move) or [`group`](#group) so that rotation makes more sense.
-}

{-| Add some image from the internet:

    main =
      picture
        [ image 96 96 "https://elm-lang.org/assets/turtle.gif"

{-| Show some words!

    import Playground exposing (..)

    main =

You can use [`scale`](#scale) to make the words bigger or smaller.
-}

words color string =
  Shape 0 0 0 1 1 (Words color string)


{-| Put shapes together so you can [`move`](#move) and [`rotate`](#rotate)
them as a group. Maybe you want to put a bunch of stars in the sky:

    import Playground exposing (..)

    main =

        [ star
            |> move 100 100

-- TRANSFORMS


{-| Move a shape by some number of pixels:

    import Playground exposing (..)

    main =
      picture
        [ square red 100
            |> move -60 60
        , square yellow 100
            |> move 60 60
        , square green 100
            |> move 60 -60
        , square blue 100
            |> move -60 -60
        ]
-}
move : Number -> Number -> Shape -> Shape
move dx dy (Shape x y a s o f) =
  Shape (x + dx) (y + dy) a s o f


{-| Move a shape up by some number of pixels. So if you wanted to make a tree
you could move the leaves up above the trunk:

    import Playground exposing (..)

    main =
      picture
        [ rectangle brown 40 200
        , circle green 100
            |> moveUp 180
        ]
-}
moveUp : Number -> Shape -> Shape
moveUp =
  moveY


{-| Move a shape down by some number of pixels. So if you wanted to put the sky
above the ground, you could move the sky up and the ground down:

    import Playground exposing (..)

    main =
      picture
        [ rectangle lightBlue 200 100
            |> moveUp 50
        , rectangle lightGreen 200 100
            |> moveDown 50
        ]
-}
moveDown : Number -> Shape -> Shape
moveDown dy (Shape x y a s o f) =
  Shape x (y - dy) a s o f


{-| Move shapes to the left.

    import Playground exposing (..)

    main =
      picture
        [ circle yellow 10
            |> moveLeft 80
            |> moveUp 30
        ]
-}
moveLeft : Number -> Shape -> Shape
moveLeft dx (Shape x y a s o f) =
  Shape (x - dx) y a s o f


{-| Move shapes to the right.

    import Playground exposing (..)

    main =
      picture
        [ square purple 20
            |> moveRight 80
            |> moveDown 100
        ]
-}
moveRight : Number -> Shape -> Shape
moveRight =
  moveX


{-| Move the `x` coordinate of a shape by some amount. Here is a square that
moves back and forth:

    import Playground exposing (..)

    main =
      animation view

    view time =
      [ square purple 20
          |> moveX (wave 4 -200 200 time)
      ]

Using `moveX` feels a bit nicer here because the movement may be positive or negative.
-}
moveX : Number -> Shape -> Shape
moveX dx (Shape x y a s o f) =
  Shape (x + dx) y a s o f


{-| Move the `y` coordinate of a shape by some amount. Maybe you want to make
grass along the bottom of the screen:

    import Playground exposing (..)

    main =
      game view update 0

    update computer memory =
      memory

    view computer count =
      [ rectangle green computer.screen.width 100
          |> moveY computer.screen.bottom
      ]

Using `moveY` feels a bit nicer when setting things relative to the bottom or
top of the screen, since the values are negative sometimes.
-}
moveY : Number -> Shape -> Shape
moveY dy (Shape x y a s o f) =
  Shape x (y + dy) a s o f


{-| Make a shape bigger or smaller. So if you wanted some [`words`](#words) to
be larger, you could say:

    import Playground exposing (..)

    main =
      picture
        [ words black "Hello, nice to see you!"
            |> scale 3
        ]
-}
scale : Number -> Shape -> Shape
scale ns (Shape x y a s o f) =
  Shape x y a (s * ns) o f


{-| Rotate shapes in degrees.

    import Playground exposing (..)

    main =
      picture
        [ words black "These words are tilted!"
            |> rotate 10
        ]

The degrees go **counter-clockwise** to match the direction of the
[unit circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_circle).
-}
rotate : Number -> Shape -> Shape
rotate da (Shape x y a s o f) =
  Shape x y (a + da) s o f


{-| Fade a shape. This lets you make shapes see-through or even completely
invisible. Here is a shape that fades in and out:

    import Playground exposing (..)

    main =
      animation view

    view time =
      [ square orange 30
      , square blue 200
          |> fade (zigzag 0 1 3 time)
      ]

The number has to be between `0` and `1`, where `0` is totally transparent
and `1` is completely solid.
-}
fade : Number -> Shape -> Shape
fade o (Shape x y a s _ f) =
  Shape x y a s o f



-- COLOR

The colors below, like `red` and `green`, come from the [Tango palette][tango].
It provides a bunch of aesthetically reasonable colors. Each color comes with a
light and dark version, so you always get a set like `lightYellow`, `yellow`,
and `darkYellow`.

-- CUSTOM COLORS


{-| RGB stands for Red-Green-Blue. With these three parts, you can create any
color you want. For example:

    brightBlue = rgb 18 147 216
    brightGreen = rgb 119 244 8
    brightPurple = rgb 94 28 221

Each number needs to be between 0 and 255.

It can be hard to figure out what numbers to pick, so try using a color picker
like [paletton][] to find colors that look nice together. Once you find nice
colors, click on the color previews to get their RGB values.
